I recently launched the early version of [Animations on the web](https://google.com), a course about web
animations. I thought it could be interesting to write about how I built the platform for
it, talk about the design process, tech stack, and more.

Why a custom platform?
{% /heading %}

I want to build things that I can be proud of. While there are a few course creation platforms out there, I wanted something that feels like me and something that I can customize to my needs, so that the students can get the best experience possible.

Why a custom platform?

Most of the things I build are monochrome, but given that this is my first paid product, I wanted to give it more personality. People often call good animations 'buttery smooth,' so I thought it would be a good idea to use a buttery yellow as the accent color. Based on that, we also worked on a melting butter logo with [Nev Flynn](https://google.com).

I'm a big fan of courses myself. I already knew that I wanted my platform to look like a mix of Josh Comeau's courses and Sam Selikoff's buildui.com. Mariana helped me design the course, it wouldn't have looked the same without her help.

We've chosen Inter as the sans font as it's readable. The mono font is called Commit Mono; I absolutely love it. I'm using it for this site and in VSCode as well.

Each lesson features a video on top, followed by a text version of the video with interactive components and additional explanations. The navigation is right next to the text; it's sticky, enabling users to easily jump to the next lesson

Authentication
{% /heading %}

Users can log in using a magic link. I use [lemonsqueezy](https://google.com) for payments. Their API lets me check whether the entered email is a paying customer.

```
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  const email = searchParams.get("email");

  const res = await fetch(
    `https://api.lemonsqueezy.com/v1/customers?filter[email]=${email}`,
    {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LEMON_SQUEEZY_KEY}`,
        Accept: "application/json",
      },
    }
  );

  const { data: foundCustomers } = await res.json();

  // ...
}
```

I wanted to keep this platform very simple and limit the number of external dependencies, so I went with the most basic MDX setup possible, which is described here.
